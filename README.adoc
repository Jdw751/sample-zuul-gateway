Up and running with Sample Spring-Cloud based app
-------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to run the entire application:

* On Local Machine

On Local Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running it all local is simple, do the following in sequence, in four different terminal windows:

.Start up Eureka
[source,java]
----
cd sample-eureka
mvn spring-boot:run
----


.Start up the Service
[source,java]
----
cd sample-svc
mvn spring-boot:run
----

.Start up the Gateway
[source,java]
----
cd sample-zuul-gateway
mvn spring-boot:run
----

If all the applications have come up cleanly, the endpoint should be available at http://localhost:8080
